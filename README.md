UCSD Bootcamp homework assignment # 6

The intent of this exercise was to review the weather as we approach the equator, and to find our next ideal vacation spot.  Humidity, cloudiness, windiness and maximum temperatures were gathered from Open Weather Maps for approximately 600 randomly selected cities and plotted using latitude and longtitude.  

Notes: 
a. The date of the date request is January 2, 2021.
b. Seasons: winter in the norhtern and summer in the southern hemisphere.
c. There appear to be more datapoints for the northern hemisphere.

The data reviewed shows the following:

1. Temperatures indeed increase as we get closer to the equator, and show a consistent gradual drop on both sides of the equator up to a latitude of +20/-20.  In the southern hemisphere temperatures remain relatively high whereas in the nothern hemisphere temperatures show a much larger drop. Please see notes b and c above.

2. Wind speeds are mostly between 0 and 10 mph worldwide, and wind speeds in excess of 20 mph are rare.  Distance from the equator nor hemispheres appear to be a factor.

3. Humidity is mostly between 70 and 90% worldwide.  Distance from the equator nor hemispheres appear to be a factor.

On this day in history, January 2, 2021, weather-wise it would be nice to hang out in Dawei, Myanmar, or Guerrero Negro, Mexico.

The intent of this exercise was to review the weather as we approach the equator, and to find our next ideal vacation spot.  Humidity, cloudiness, windiness and maximum temperatures were gathered from the Open Weather Maps for approximately 600 randomly selected cities and plotted using latitude and longtitude.  

Notes: The data was pulled on January 2, 2021.  Seasons: winter in the norhtern and summer in the southern hemisphere. There appear to be more datapoints for the northern hemisphere.

The data shows the following:

1. Temperatures are indeed warmer as we get closer to the equator.  In the southern hemisphere temperatures remain relatively high whereas in the nothern hemisphere temperatures show a much larger drop. 

2. Wind speeds are mostly between 0 and 10 mph no matter where, and wind speeds in excess of 20 mph are rare.

3. Humidity is mostly between 70 and 90% everywhere.

On this day in history, January 2, 2021, weather-wise it would be nice to hang out in Dawei, Myanmar, or Guerrero Negro, Mexico.
